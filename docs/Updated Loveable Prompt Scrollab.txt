1. Updated Loveable Prompt: Scrollable Feed + Swipe Cards
Update the FUZO app’s Feed page to combine Instagram-style vertical scrolling with Tinder-style left/right swipe actions on each post card.

Pull posts from Supabase posts table, ordered by created_at (most recent first)

Each post should appear as a full-width card that includes:

image_url (photo)

tag (badge at top-right)

title (bold)

location (subtext)

shared_by (“Shared by @...”)

Icons: ❤️ Like, 🍽️ Save, 🔗 Share

Swipe Gestures:

Swiping right on a card adds it to the user’s Plate

Swiping left removes the card from the feed permanently

Support vertical scroll of the entire feed, but make each card independently swipeable left or right.

Design the cards with soft shadows, rounded corners, and bold colors consistent with FUZO’s theme. Keep the bottom navigation bar fixed.


2. Add animated toast notifications to the FUZO Feed screen for both swipe directions:

When a user swipes right on a post (Save to Plate):

Show a toast with message: “🍽️ Saved to Plate”

Animate: rise up from the bottom with ease-out, then fade out after 1.5–2 seconds

Style: green background, white bold text, rounded corners, soft shadow

When a user swipes left on a post (Dismiss):

Show a toast with message: “❌ Skipped”

Animate the same way: rise from bottom, fade out

Style: soft red or gray background, white bold text, same rounded style

Ensure both toasts:

Do not block bottom navigation

Are responsive on small screens

Only one is visible at a time

Use consistent animation timing
